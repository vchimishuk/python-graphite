NAME
    python-pygraphite is a Python3 library to send Graphite metrics

DOCUMENTATION
    python-pygraphite periodically makes metrics snapshot and sends to Graphite
    over TCP protocol. If send operation failed metrics are stored inside buffer
    and will be sent withing next attempt.

EXAMPLE
    import pygraphite

    # Create client.
    g = pygraphite.Graphite('graphite.host', 2003, prefix='my-app')

    # Create gauge metric. Gauge value will be generated every time snapshot is
    # created.
    g.gauge('gauge', lambda: int(time.time()))

    # Simple counter metric.
    g.counter('counter').inc()

    # Series metric calculates sum, min, max, count, average, median,
    # 75, 95 and 99 percentiles values.
    g.series('series').add(1.4)

    # Close client at the end, to be sure that all metrics have been sent
    # and internal thread terminated.
    g.close()
